# Knowledge Sharing: My 2026 Commitment

I’m making a public commitment this year: share what I already know and learn—consistently. Knowledge compounds faster when it’s shared, and teams benefit when lessons are visible, practical, and easy to reuse.

You get practical, reusable insights you can apply next week.

Here’s the simple cadence I’ll follow:

- Monday: People + leadership — trust, feedback, team habits.
- Wednesday: Technology foundations — cloud architecture, frameworks, and key AI libraries.
- Friday: Business + product — decision‑making, ROI, and risk framing.

I’m also inviting colleagues and friends to collaborate: share stories, examples, and code snippets. If you want to co‑write or suggest a topic, I’d love your help.

This Friday I’ll summarize hot AI business trends and the opportunities they create. Next Monday we begin the weekly cadence.

Comment "People" / "Technology" / "Business" with a topic, or DM to co‑write.
