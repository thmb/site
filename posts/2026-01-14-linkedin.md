One of the most common cloud architecture decisions is still the same: Serverless or Kubernetes?

In reality, this choice is rarely purely technical.
It’s shaped by team experience, risk tolerance, and operational maturity.

I’ve found it useful to frame it around two clear scenarios:

1️⃣ Serverless fits best when simplicity matters

Low compute requirements

Modest data volumes

Simple, well-defined workflows

Example:
<10K API requests/month, ~100 GB storage, classic frontend + backend + database.

2️⃣ Kubernetes makes sense when scale or flexibility matters

Sustained or heavy workloads

Long-running or frequent jobs

Complex data flows or orchestration

Example:
High-throughput APIs, mixed storage/database needs, custom workflows.

Key trade-offs ⚠️

Kubernetes brings portability and control—but higher operational overhead.

Serverless reduces early maintenance—but adds constraints and potential vendor lock-in.

Pragmatic approach

Start serverless, but design for exit (isolated logic, containers, no exotic features).

Or start small with Kubernetes (e.g., single-node K3S) and scale when needed.

There’s no universal “best” option—only better trade-offs for a given context.
