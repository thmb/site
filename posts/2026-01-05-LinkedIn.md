# The Most Important AI Resource

The scarcest resource in AI isn’t GPUs, data, or models: it’s a team that can execute.

AI isn’t about experimentation anymore—it’s about execution. And that’s mostly a people problem with direct business consequences: it affects time-to-value—and whether anything ships.

From my perspective, most AI initiatives don’t fail because the model is “bad”—they fail in the messy middle: unclear ownership, slow feedback loops, weak data contracts, and missing production habits.

Execution breaks when:

- Nobody owns the end-to-end outcome (not just the model).
- Product, data, and engineering move in different directions.
- The team can’t surface issues early and fix them fast.

Two questions I ask when leading AI initiatives:

- Do we trust each other enough to disagree, learn fast, and fix issues together?
- Do we have (or can we build) the skills needed beyond our comfort zones?

Almost nobody is a “deep expert” in every part of modern AI. The teams that win are the ones that collaborate well and keep learning.

Leading an AI team today: what’s the bigger gap—trust to disagree + learn fast, or skills beyond comfort zones?

Big thank you to all extraordinary people I had the opportunity to work and learn with, including my students!
