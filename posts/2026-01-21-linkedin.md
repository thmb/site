Artificial Intelligence is what excites me the most right now — not the hype, but turning ideas into real, working products.

After experimenting with multiple AI-driven systems, I’ve converged on a very opinionated (and pragmatic) stack:

React / React Native → one mindset for web & mobile, faster iteration, fewer context switches

FastAPI → Python-native, async-first, and extremely friendly to AI/ML workflows

PostgreSQL → not “just a database”: extensions, vector support, reliability at scale

S3-compatible object storage → the de-facto standard for unstructured data

This combo lets me move fast without painting myself into a corner:
prototype quickly, scale responsibly, and keep architectural optionality.

Curious to hear from others building real AI products:
