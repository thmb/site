# LinkedIn Posting Guideline (Authority-Building Checklist)

Use this document as a **pre‑publish checklist** to create LinkedIn posts that are engaging, readable, and algorithm‑friendly. The **goal** is to build trust, signal long‑term thinking, and invite real conversations — not chase virality.

## 1. Content Size (Mobile-First)

**Target length**
- 700–1,300 characters
- ~120–250 words

**Rules**
- Must fit roughly **one mobile screen + a bit**
- Prefer clarity over completeness
- One core idea per post

## 2. Structure & Layout (Scan‑First)

LinkedIn users scan before they read. Optimize for skimming.

### Recommended structure

1. **Hook (first 1–2 lines)**
   - Stops scrolling
   - No greetings
   - No hashtags
   - Clear, opinionated, or curiosity‑driven

2. **Context (2–3 short lines)**
   - Why this topic matters
   - Business or real‑world framing

3. **Core Value (delivery)**
   - Short lines
   - White space between ideas
   - Bullet points or numbered list
   - Use emojis sparingly (✅ ⚠️ ❌)

4. **Close (engagement / question)**
   - Ask a low‑effort, open question
   - Invite perspectives, not validation
   - Avoid explicit CTAs like “comment below”

## 3. Images (Optional, but Intentional)

**Use an image only if it adds clarity.**

Best image types:
- Minimal text visuals with a single idea
- Simple diagrams (architecture, flow, decision tree)
- One‑slide summaries (easy to download)

Image rules:
- 1 image per post
- Square (1:1) or vertical
- High contrast, minimal detail

Avoid:
- Stock photos
- Generic business visuals
- Overcrowded diagrams

## 4. Hashtags

**3–5 hashtags max**, placed at the **end** of the post.

Guidelines:
- Mix niche + broad hashtags
- Keep them relevant to the topic

Avoid:
- Hashtags inside sentences
- Engagement‑bait hashtags (#like, #follow)
- More than 5 hashtags

## 5. Posting Frequency & Timing

**Frequency**
- 2–3 posts per week
- Consistency > volume

**Timing (general guidance)**
- Tuesday to Thursday
- Morning (8–10am) or early afternoon

## 6. High‑Performing Content Types

Rotate formats to build authority:

- Lessons learned ("I learned this the hard way")
- Opinionated takes (respectful, clear stance)
- Comparisons (A vs B, trade‑offs)
- Checklists / frameworks
- Short stories → insight

## 7. What the LinkedIn Algorithm Favors

- Dwell time (people stop to read)
- Meaningful comments
- Early engagement (first 60–90 minutes)
- Native content (no links in the post body)

Tip:
- If sharing a link, put it in the **first comment**

## 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Wall of text
- Over‑hashtagging
- Corporate or marketing tone
- Teaching without perspective
- External links in the main post

Authority comes from **clarity + conviction**.

### Simple Posting Template

Use this template to draft quickly:

```
Strong hook that challenges a belief or highlights a problem.

Why this matters in real‑world or business terms.

Here’s what I’ve learned / observed:
- Point one
- Point two
- Point three

The trade‑off or insight most people miss.

What’s your take on this?
```

### Final Pre‑Publish Checklist

Before publishing, confirm each item:

- [ ] The first 1–2 lines work as a strong hook (would *I* stop scrolling?)
- [ ] The post fits ~700–1,300 characters / 120–250 words
- [ ] Only **one main idea** is discussed
- [ ] Paragraphs are short and easy to scan on mobile
- [ ] Bullets or numbered lists are used where appropriate
- [ ] Business value is explicit (why this matters)
- [ ] Technical depth supports the message (not the other way around)
- [ ] Optional image adds clarity (not decoration)
- [ ] No links in the post body (links go in comments if needed)
- [ ] 3–5 relevant hashtags placed at the end
- [ ] Closing question invites thoughtful discussion
- [ ] Tone is human, confident, and not corporate

Tips (ask an AI tool for):
- Honest review score (e.g., 0–10 readiness)
- Any suggestion to improve the content
