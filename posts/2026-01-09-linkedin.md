# AI Trends: The Year of Agentic Workflows

The "Chatbot Era" is over. 2026 is the year of Agentic Workflows.

Most companies are still stuck trying to perfect RAG pipelines, but the leaders have already moved on. They aren't building AI that talks; they are building AI that *do*.

I’ve been analyzing the 2026 outlook from Andrew Ng and IBM, and the signal is clear:

1. **Agentic Reasoning > Better Models**
   The massive gains this year won't come from a larger GPT-6. It comes from wrapping models in loops (planning, critiquing, iterating). It's an architectural shift, not a model shift.

2. **The "Check-in" Human**
   We are moving from "human-in-the-loop" (approving every step) to "human-on-the-loop" (handling exceptions).

3. **Quantum is creeping in**
   Optimizing these agent swarms is computationally heavy. The intersection of Agentic AI and Quantum (as highlighted by IBM) is where the next efficiency jump happens.

The trade-off? Agents are slower and more expensive per token, but they solve problems zero-shot models can't touch.

Are you building agents yet, or still polishing prompts?
